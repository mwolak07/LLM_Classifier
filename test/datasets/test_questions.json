    "max_question": "With the following passages:\nHow much time does it take for the body to absorb water into the system after drinking it? Submitted by - C.Y. W., Rowland Heights, CA. Answer: If you like absolute answers, you'll be disappointed to read water absorption rates vary. Some water is absorbed within seconds to minutes from the mouth and stomach. After that, the sooner water is emptied from the stomach, the faster it is absorbed, since the maximum rate of absorption occurs in the small intestine. How fast the stomach empties depends on the temp of the water, with cooler water emptying out more quickly.\n\nSkin (percutaneous, dermal) absorption is the transport of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into the skin and into circulation. Skin absorption relates to the degree of exposure to and possible effect of a substance which may enter the body through the skin. Human skin comes into contact with many agents intentionally and unintentionally.\n\nAll About Absorption. Knowing how your body absorbs nutrients can help you fuel Your workouts \u2013 and your life. Before I knew better, I thought caffeine was one of the major food groups. A hit first thing in the morning, followed by several more throughout the day, and I was the queen of productivity.\n\nFiber in foods will help your body retain water in the intestines, where it is slowly absorbed. This means that instead of just passing through fast, it\u2019ll take its time and your body can use all the water it can. Can we absorb water in ways other than drinking? In short, no. In a more detailed answer, kind of but not really. There are a lot of curious people on the internet asking if water can be absorbed via the skin, like if you take a long shower or bath.\n\nIt must be remembered that alcohol is a lipid that is water soluble, so it can be digested soon after absorption. Alcohol absorption into the bloodstream takes place throughout the gastrointestinal tract. When alcohol reaches the bloodstream, it is very quickly distributed throughout the body. Body tissues absorb alcohol at different rates.\n\n3) Timing. Since we now know that most water is absorbed within 120 minutes, we can assume that drinking a glass of water about 2 hours before heavy sports will give us the best benefit, as your body will be the most hydrated then.\n\nA number of factors influence the absorption process, including the presence of food and the type of food in the gastrointestinal tract when alcohol is consumed. The rate at which alcohol is absorbed depends on how quickly the stomach empties its contents into the intestine.\n\nI first started wondering about how long after a drink of water does it take to enter the body\u2019s system after realizing I was feeling dehydrated and was about to go play volleyball. I didn\u2019t know if drinking a glass of water right then would help when I was about to play a sport an hour later. I know that you should drink \u20198 glasses a day\u2019, but if you\u2019re feeling dehydrated, or if you just worked out and your muscles were feeling fatigued, how long does it really take for that first mouthfull of water to help?\n\nIf you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the small intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes (faster if the water is colder, compared to warm!). If you\u2019re eating while drinking the water, you may have to wait upwards of 45 minutes before the water is passed into the intestines because the stomach must digest the food first. Overall, on average, it takes from 5 minutes to a total of 120 minutes for water to fully absorb into your bloodstream from the time of drinking. The University of Montreal did a study poetically called \u201cPharmacokinetic analysis of absorption, distribution and disappearance of ingested water labeled with D\u2082O in humans.\u201d which has graphs and timelines explaining their study if you like that kind of stuff.\n\nSurfactants like sodium lauryl-sulfate increase the skin penetration of water-soluble substances, possibly by increasing the skin permeability of water. Medical use of skin absorption. Dermal application of a medication or chemical allows treatment to be localized, unlike ingestion or injection.\n\nSarin, a nerve gas, can be absorbed through intact skin and be lethal at low concentrations. Thus if one needs to assess the risk of Sarin exposure one must take skin absorption and other routes into account but one cannot ethically test Sarin on human subjects; thus ways of modeling the risk from skin exposure of the agent have been found.\n\nExposure modeling depends on several factors and assumptions. 1  The surface area of skin exposed. 2  The duration of exposure (in hours, minutes, etc.) 3  The concentration of the chemical. 4  The permeability coefficient of the chemical (how easy it is for the chemical to get through the skin). 5  The weight of the person.\n\nSkin absorption is a route by which substances can enter the body through the skin. Along with inhalation, ingestion and injection, dermal absorption is a route of exposure for toxic substances and route of administration for medication.\n\nOverall, they found that the 45 minute mark, and the 600ml amount were the average. There have also been studies that show over-drinking is an issue, especially in cases of strenuous activity like marathons. On average, the body can only absorb 400-600ml per hour, so drinking more than that is just a waste.\n\n1 I\u2019m sorry, but this statement seems flawed: \u201cIf you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the large intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes\u201d The stomach does not empty directly into the large intestine, it empties into the small intestine.\n\n3) Timing. Since we now know that most water is absorbed within 120 minutes, we can assume that drinking a glass of water about 2 hours before heavy sports will give us the best benefit, as your body will be the most hydrated then.\n\nHow long does it take to absorb water into the body? I first started wondering how long after a drink of water does it take to enter the body\u2019s system. I know that you should drink \u20198 glasses a day\u2019, but if you\u2019re feeling dehydrated, how long does it really take for that first mouthfull of water to help?\n\nAlcohol is a Drug. When an alcoholic beverage is consumed it passes down the esophagus through the stomach and into the small intestine. Although a small amount of alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous membrane, the vast majority of alcohol enters the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. Alcohol is water soluble and the bloodstream rapidly transports the ethanol throughout the body where it is absorbed into the body tissues in proportion to their water content. Ethanol is greatly diluted by the body fluids.\n\nTo be absorbed through the skin, a chemical must pass through the epidermis, glands, or hair follicles. Sweat glands and hair follicles make up about 0.1 to 1.0 percent of the total skin surface. Though small amounts of chemicals may enter the body rapidly through the glands or hair follicles, they are primarily absorbed through the epidermis.\n\nBut here is where the aforementioned \u2019conditions\u2019 are in play. If you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the large intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes(especially if the water is colder, compared to warm!).\n\nThis model takes into account that not all water carrying a chemical that comes into contact with skin stays on the skin long enough to allow absorption. Only that portion of a chemical in the solution that stays in contact with the skin is available for absorption. This may be modeled using water adherence factors as postulated by Gujral 2011\n\nAlcohol Metabolism Metabolism is a general term applied to the chemical processes that take place within tissues in the body by converting food or liquids to obtain nutrients. When alcohol is ingested, about 20 percent is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. The rest is absorbed as it progresses through the gastrointestinal tract. A small amount of alcohol is not metabolized and is excreted through sweat, saliva, urine, and the breath.\n\nBut here is where the aforementioned \u2019conditions\u2019 are in play. If you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the large intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes(especially if the water is colder, compared to warm!). But, if you\u2019re eating while drinking the water, you may have to wait upwards of 45 minutes before the water is passed into the intestines because the stomach must digest the food first.

These dead cells soak up the water, causing them to bloat and wrinkle the skin, but the water really doesn\u2019t get anywhere past them. So your 1 hour baths can still make you thirsty.\n\nComments (9) 1  October 19th, 2011 at 21:08 | #1. 2  October 19th, 2011 at 23:01 | #2. 3  October 20th, 2011 at 00:27 | #3. 4  October 20th, 2011 at 08:13 | #4. 5  October 20th, 2011 at 17:39 | #5. 6  October 20th, 2011 at 20:50 | #6. 7  October 20th, 2011 at 21:18 | #7. 8  October 20th, 2011 at 22:04 | #8. 9  December 5th, 2015 at 18:01 | #9.\n\nBut if you're thirsty, and you drink a load of water, it's going to be absorbed pretty darn quick. You can get a rough idea of water absorption rates by sucking down a glass of alcohol, such as whiskey (assuming you're over 21 of course), and noting how much time elapses before you feel it. It will not be long.\n\nThey found that the water started showing up in the bloodstream within five minutes; half of the water was absorbed in 11-13 minutes; and it was completely absorbed in 75-120 minutes. Here\u2019s what the data looks like: On the left, it shows how quickly the water was absorbed in the first hour, measured in the blood. On the right, it shows the gradual decay of deuterium levels over the subsequent 10 days, measured from urine samples. This, of course, shows that when I pee after drinking a glass of water, I\u2019m not peeing out the same glass of water! Within ~10 minutes, fluid levels in my blood will have risen sufficiently to trigger processes that tell me to pee \u2014 but, according to this data, it takes about 50 days for complete turnover of all the water in your body.\n\nPlease answer this query: how long does it take to absorb oxygen into the bloodstream through water\nIf it is not possible to answer the query using the given prompts, please state: No Answer Present.\n",

        "With the following passages:\n1 Plot chemical potential energy of the system as a function of the reaction coordinate. 2  Explain the model k = A exp (E a / RT) for chemical kinetics. 3  Plot k versus 1/ T when k is measured at several T. 4  Calculate E a when a series of k and T are given. 5  Calculate k at certain T.\n\nSymbolically, activation energy is represented as Ea, and uses the units of kilojoules per mole of reactant. The Arrhenius equation gives the relationship between activation energy and the rate of a chemical reaction. E a = -RT*ln(k/A). In this equation, k is reaction rate constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the ambient temperature in kelvin.\n\nThe distribution of kinetic energy amongst molecules and the required energy for molecules to react give rise to the activation energy. The activation energy quantitatively describes the effect of temperature on reaction rates.\n\nwhich is the equation of a straight line whose slope is \u2013 Ea / R. This affords a simple way of determining the activation energy from values of k observed at different temperatures; we just plot ln k as a function of 1/ T.\n\n1 It's not enough that the wavelength of the light correspond to the activation energy; it must also fall within the absorption spectrum of the molecule, and (in a complex molecule) enough of it must end up in the right part of the molecule, such as in a particular bond. 2  Electrochemical activation.\n\n1 Explain activation energy. 2  Describe how energy vary during a chemical reaction. 3  Plot chemical potential energy of the system as a function of the reaction coordinate. 4  Explain the model k = A exp (E a / RT) for chemical kinetics. 5  Plot k versus 1/ T when k is measured at several T.\n\nEa =\u2013 (8.314 J mol \u20131 K \u20131) (\u20133.27 \u00d7 10 4 K) = 273 kJ mol \u20131. Comment: This activation energy is rather high, which is not surprising because a carbon-carbon bond must be broken in order to open the cyclopropane ring.\n\nOne way to lower the activation energy in a reaction is with a chemical catalyst. In chemistry (as distinct from biology) a catalyst serves the purpose of lowering the activation energy in a reaction by changing the transition state of the reaction. In this process, the catalyst is by definition not consumed in the reaction.\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that other sources of activation energy are sometimes applicable: 1  Absorption of light by a molecule (photoexcitation) can be a very clean and efficient, but it doesn't always work. 2  Electrochemical activation.\n\nEven a modest activation energy of 50 kJ/mol reduces the rate by a factor of 10 8. The logarithmic scale in the right-hand plot leads to nice straight lines, as described under the next heading below. Looking at the role of temperature, we see a similar effect.\n\nPlease answer this query: what units is activation energy in\nIf it is not possible to answer the query using the given prompts, please state: No Answer Present.\n",

        "With the following passages:\nKnowledge center. Rabies is a deadly virus that attacks the CNS (central nervous system) and causes acute encephalitis. It is transmitted from animals to humans (zoonotic), most commonly by animal bites-although, there have been cases of humans becoming infected in bat caves after breathing in the air. Rabies infection is nearly always fatal unless prompt treatment is administered before symptoms begin.\n\nThe incubation period for rabies-how long it takes from initial infection to the onset of symptoms-is usually about 4 to 8 weeks long, in some cases as little as one week and as long as a whole year. Over 55,000 people die from rabies worldwide annually, 95% of them in Asia and Africa.\n\nHighly fatal infectious disease transmitted by the bite of infected animals, including dogs, cats, skunks, wolves, foxes, raccoons, and bats, and caused by a neurotropic lyssavirus that replicates in the central nervous system and the salivary glands.\n\nRabies is an acute viral disease of the central nervous system that affects humans and other mammals but is most common in carnivores (flesh-eaters). It is sometimes referred to as a zoonosis, or disease of animals that can be communicated to humans.\n\nTreating rabies. If you have been exposed (bitten, scratched or licked) by an animal that might have rabies, you'll need to seek medical advice to determine whether you need to have a course of treatment to prevent rabies. This is called post-exposure treatment.\n\nThe rabies vaccine should be given in every case of suspected exposure to rabies. The length of your vaccination course will depend on whether you have previously been vaccinated. You should receive five doses of the vaccine if you've never been vaccinated.\n\nThe rabies virus is usually transmitted via an animal bite, however, cases have also been reported in which the virus penetrated the body through infected saliva, moist tissues such as the eyes or lips, a scratch on the skin, or the transplantation of infected tissues.\n\nRabies immunoglobulin. If you've been in a high-risk situation, you may also be given an injection of rabies immunoglobulin as well as the rabies vaccination. This helps protect you against the virus while your body is developing antibodies after vaccination.\n\n1 To do this, the HRIG vaccine is administered once, at the beginning of treatment. 2  Half of the dose is given around the bite area, and the rest is given in the muscle. 3  Inactivated viral material (antigenic) is then given to stimulate the patient's own immune system to produce antibodies against rabies.\n\nThe rabies virus is part of the Lyssavirus genus and infects other animals, including humans, through infected saliva, usually from a bite. Much less commonly, a person can become infected if an open wound or mucous membranes have contact with infected saliva.\n\nPlease answer this query: what is rabies called in medicine\nIf it is not possible to answer the query using the given prompts, please state: No Answer Present.\n"
