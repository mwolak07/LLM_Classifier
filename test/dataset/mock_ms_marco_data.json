Answer: If you like absolute answers, you'll be disappointed to read water absorption rates vary. Some water is absorbed within seconds to minutes from the mouth and stomach. After that, the sooner water is emptied from the stomach, the faster it is absorbed, since the maximum rate of absorption occurs in the small intestine. How fast the stomach empties depends on the temp of the water, with cooler water emptying out more quickly.",
