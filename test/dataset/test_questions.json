    "max_question": "Using only the following context:\nHow much time does it take for the body to absorb water into the system after drinking it? Submitted by - C.Y. W., Rowland Heights, CA. Answer: If you like absolute answers, you'll be disappointed to read water absorption rates vary. Some water is absorbed within seconds to minutes from the mouth and stomach. After that, the sooner water is emptied from the stomach, the faster it is absorbed, since the maximum rate of absorption occurs in the small intestine. How fast the stomach empties depends on the temp of the water, with cooler water emptying out more quickly.\n\nSkin (percutaneous, dermal) absorption is the transport of chemicals from the outer surface of the skin both into the skin and into circulation. Skin absorption relates to the degree of exposure to and possible effect of a substance which may enter the body through the skin. Human skin comes into contact with many agents intentionally and unintentionally.\n\nAll About Absorption. Knowing how your body absorbs nutrients can help you fuel Your workouts \u2013 and your life. Before I knew better, I thought caffeine was one of the major food groups. A hit first thing in the morning, followed by several more throughout the day, and I was the queen of productivity.\n\nFiber in foods will help your body retain water in the intestines, where it is slowly absorbed. This means that instead of just passing through fast, it\u2019ll take its time and your body can use all the water it can. Can we absorb water in ways other than drinking? In short, no. In a more detailed answer, kind of but not really. There are a lot of curious people on the internet asking if water can be absorbed via the skin, like if you take a long shower or bath.\n\nIt must be remembered that alcohol is a lipid that is water soluble, so it can be digested soon after absorption. Alcohol absorption into the bloodstream takes place throughout the gastrointestinal tract. When alcohol reaches the bloodstream, it is very quickly distributed throughout the body. Body tissues absorb alcohol at different rates.\n\n3) Timing. Since we now know that most water is absorbed within 120 minutes, we can assume that drinking a glass of water about 2 hours before heavy sports will give us the best benefit, as your body will be the most hydrated then.\n\nA number of factors influence the absorption process, including the presence of food and the type of food in the gastrointestinal tract when alcohol is consumed. The rate at which alcohol is absorbed depends on how quickly the stomach empties its contents into the intestine.\n\nI first started wondering about how long after a drink of water does it take to enter the body\u2019s system after realizing I was feeling dehydrated and was about to go play volleyball. I didn\u2019t know if drinking a glass of water right then would help when I was about to play a sport an hour later. I know that you should drink \u20198 glasses a day\u2019, but if you\u2019re feeling dehydrated, or if you just worked out and your muscles were feeling fatigued, how long does it really take for that first mouthfull of water to help?\n\nIf you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the small intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes (faster if the water is colder, compared to warm!). If you\u2019re eating while drinking the water, you may have to wait upwards of 45 minutes before the water is passed into the intestines because the stomach must digest the food first. Overall, on average, it takes from 5 minutes to a total of 120 minutes for water to fully absorb into your bloodstream from the time of drinking. The University of Montreal did a study poetically called \u201cPharmacokinetic analysis of absorption, distribution and disappearance of ingested water labeled with D\u2082O in humans.\u201d which has graphs and timelines explaining their study if you like that kind of stuff.\n\nSurfactants like sodium lauryl-sulfate increase the skin penetration of water-soluble substances, possibly by increasing the skin permeability of water. Medical use of skin absorption. Dermal application of a medication or chemical allows treatment to be localized, unlike ingestion or injection.\n\nSarin, a nerve gas, can be absorbed through intact skin and be lethal at low concentrations. Thus if one needs to assess the risk of Sarin exposure one must take skin absorption and other routes into account but one cannot ethically test Sarin on human subjects; thus ways of modeling the risk from skin exposure of the agent have been found.\n\nExposure modeling depends on several factors and assumptions. 1  The surface area of skin exposed. 2  The duration of exposure (in hours, minutes, etc.) 3  The concentration of the chemical. 4  The permeability coefficient of the chemical (how easy it is for the chemical to get through the skin). 5  The weight of the person.\n\nSkin absorption is a route by which substances can enter the body through the skin. Along with inhalation, ingestion and injection, dermal absorption is a route of exposure for toxic substances and route of administration for medication.\n\nOverall, they found that the 45 minute mark, and the 600ml amount were the average. There have also been studies that show over-drinking is an issue, especially in cases of strenuous activity like marathons. On average, the body can only absorb 400-600ml per hour, so drinking more than that is just a waste.\n\n1 I\u2019m sorry, but this statement seems flawed: \u201cIf you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the large intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes\u201d The stomach does not empty directly into the large intestine, it empties into the small intestine.\n\n3) Timing. Since we now know that most water is absorbed within 120 minutes, we can assume that drinking a glass of water about 2 hours before heavy sports will give us the best benefit, as your body will be the most hydrated then.\n\nHow long does it take to absorb water into the body? I first started wondering how long after a drink of water does it take to enter the body\u2019s system. I know that you should drink \u20198 glasses a day\u2019, but if you\u2019re feeling dehydrated, how long does it really take for that first mouthfull of water to help?\n\nAlcohol is a Drug. When an alcoholic beverage is consumed it passes down the esophagus through the stomach and into the small intestine. Although a small amount of alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream through the mucous membrane, the vast majority of alcohol enters the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine. Alcohol is water soluble and the bloodstream rapidly transports the ethanol throughout the body where it is absorbed into the body tissues in proportion to their water content. Ethanol is greatly diluted by the body fluids.\n\nTo be absorbed through the skin, a chemical must pass through the epidermis, glands, or hair follicles. Sweat glands and hair follicles make up about 0.1 to 1.0 percent of the total skin surface. Though small amounts of chemicals may enter the body rapidly through the glands or hair follicles, they are primarily absorbed through the epidermis.\n\nBut here is where the aforementioned \u2019conditions\u2019 are in play. If you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the large intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes(especially if the water is colder, compared to warm!).\n\nThis model takes into account that not all water carrying a chemical that comes into contact with skin stays on the skin long enough to allow absorption. Only that portion of a chemical in the solution that stays in contact with the skin is available for absorption. This may be modeled using water adherence factors as postulated by Gujral 2011\n\nAlcohol Metabolism Metabolism is a general term applied to the chemical processes that take place within tissues in the body by converting food or liquids to obtain nutrients. When alcohol is ingested, about 20 percent is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. The rest is absorbed as it progresses through the gastrointestinal tract. A small amount of alcohol is not metabolized and is excreted through sweat, saliva, urine, and the breath.\n\nBut here is where the aforementioned \u2019conditions\u2019 are in play. If you drink water on an empty stomach, it can pass through the stomach into the large intestine and enter your bloodstream within 5 minutes(especially if the water is colder, compared to warm!). But, if you\u2019re eating while drinking the water, you may have to wait upwards of 45 minutes before the water is passed into the intestines because the stomach must digest the food first. Overall, on average, it takes from 5 minutes to a total of 120 minutes for water to fully absorb into your bloodstream from the time of drinking.

These dead cells soak up the water, causing them to bloat and wrinkle the skin, but the water really doesn\u2019t get anywhere past them. So your 1 hour baths can still make you thirsty.\n\nComments (9) 1  October 19th, 2011 at 21:08 | #1. 2  October 19th, 2011 at 23:01 | #2. 3  October 20th, 2011 at 00:27 | #3. 4  October 20th, 2011 at 08:13 | #4. 5  October 20th, 2011 at 17:39 | #5. 6  October 20th, 2011 at 20:50 | #6. 7  October 20th, 2011 at 21:18 | #7. 8  October 20th, 2011 at 22:04 | #8. 9  December 5th, 2015 at 18:01 | #9.\n\nBut if you're thirsty, and you drink a load of water, it's going to be absorbed pretty darn quick. You can get a rough idea of water absorption rates by sucking down a glass of alcohol, such as whiskey (assuming you're over 21 of course), and noting how much time elapses before you feel it. It will not be long.\n\nThey found that the water started showing up in the bloodstream within five minutes; half of the water was absorbed in 11-13 minutes; and it was completely absorbed in 75-120 minutes. Here\u2019s what the data looks like: On the left, it shows how quickly the water was absorbed in the first hour, measured in the blood. On the right, it shows the gradual decay of deuterium levels over the subsequent 10 days, measured from urine samples. This, of course, shows that when I pee after drinking a glass of water, I\u2019m not peeing out the same glass of water! Within ~10 minutes, fluid levels in my blood will have risen sufficiently to trigger processes that tell me to pee \u2014 but, according to this data, it takes about 50 days for complete turnover of all the water in your body.\n\nThe answer, in complete sentences, to the question, \"how long does it take to absorb oxygen into the bloodstream through water?\", is:\n",

At these times, the high tides are very high and the low tides are very low. This is known as a spring high tide. Spring tides are especially strong tides (they do not have anything to do with the season Spring). They occur when the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon are in a line.

The gear can achieve a higher gear ratio than spur gears of the same size.\n\n781 878 1512 Fax 781 878 6708 www.gearseds.com Gear Terms and Types Spur gears have been used since ancient times. Figure 6.3.1.1 shows an illustration of the two-man drive system that Leonardo Davinci designed to power a his vision of a helicopter like device. The device never flew, but the gear system works.\n\nMartin WORK: When force moves a body a measured distanceprovided the motion is in the direction of the force.W (work) = Force (lbs.) X Distance (ft.)The energy of a body may be defined as the abilityof a body to do work.\n\nOne way to do this is to change the gear OD dimension to be that of the actual gear part OD, and. then add an extruded surface, based on a sketched circle, to represent the pitch diameter. Then in. the assembly you can select this surface as the gear mate reference. 2 Gear modeling \u2013 using the SolidWorks Toolbox add-in. SolidWorks will automatically create a gear part for you, if you have access to the Toolbox add-in.\n\nGears are Power transmission elements. It is the Gears that decides the torque, speed and direction of rotation of all the driven machine elements. Broadly speaking, Gear types may be grouped into five major categories. They are Spur, Helical, Bevel, Hypoid, and Worm. A lot of intricacies are there in the different types of gears.\n\nThis session will look at methods of creating solid models of gears as individual parts and how they can be mated in an assembly, to simulate motion behavior. We will consider a simple example of a pair of spur gears with a speed ratio of 2:1. We will use items from HPC Gears Ltd. part nos. YG4-34 & YG4-68.\n\n781 878 1512 Fax 781 878 6708 www.gearseds.com Ratios Gears of the same pitch, but differing numbers of teeth can be paired to obtain a wide range of Gear Ratios. Gear Ratios are used to increase mechanical advantage (torque) or increase rotational speed or velocity.\n\nMITER GEARS: These are bevel gears that have 1 to 1 ratio and arealways 90\u201d shaft axis to shaft axis.Pitch angle is the sum of the pitch lines extendedwhich meet at a point called the apex. This sum isusually 90\u201d but special gear sets can be manufac-tured for any angle up to 180\u201d.\n\nWe find the RPM of the green (driven) gear by dividing 100 RPM/1.6 = 62.5 RPM. Both the red and green center gears are turning at 62.5 RPM. The red center gear now drives the blue gear on the right. The ratio between the red center gear and the blue gear is also 36T: 60T or 1.6:1. We find the RPM of the blue (driven) gear by dividing 62.5 RPM/1.6 = 39.06 RPM.\n\nThe helical gears are a refinement over spur gears. The teeth on helical gears are specially cut at an angle, so as to face the gear. As two teeth on the gear system engage, it starts a contact on one end of the tooth which gradually spreads with the gear rotation, until the time when both the tooth are fully engaged.\n\nThe answer, in complete sentences, to the question, \"what kind of surface can a gear rotate on?\", is:\n",
