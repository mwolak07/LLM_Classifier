    "With the following passages:\nA: The most common cause of new or come-and-go tongue swelling (or swelling of the lip or throat) is a type of allergic reaction called angioedema.. Sudden tongue swelling can sometimes be dangerous because it could block your airway. Two types of angioedema can lead to a swollen tongue: 1.\n\nWhile many of us do not usually think about the health of our tongues, a number of conditions can affect this muscle. Tongue inflammation is one such condition. Tongue inflammation occurs when the tongue becomes swollen and possibly discolored. This can make the tongue appear as if it is smooth.\n\nSymptoms of tongue inflammation will depend on the severity of your condition and the health condition causing it. Common symptoms associated with tongue inflammation include: 1  problems chewing, swallowing, or speaking. 2  a sore or tender tongue. 3  changes in the color of your tongue (pale or red).\n\nPernicious Anemia Article. 1  Pernicious anemia facts. 2  What is pernicious anemia? 3  What is megaloblastic anemia? 4  What causes pernicious anemia? 5  Is pernicious anemia the same as vitamin B-12 deficiency anemia? 6  What are the symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency/ pernicious anemia? 7  How is pernicious anemia/vitamin B-12 deficiency diagnosed? 8  What is the ...\n\nYour doctor may also note swelling of the tongue. If you have symptoms of tongue inflammation, your doctor may ask you about your health history and recent trauma to the mouth or tongue in an effort to determine the underlying cause. He or she may ask about new toothpastes, new foods, or other triggers that might have caused a sudden onset.\n\nAnxiety may also be the cause. You'd be surprised how many people experience swollen tongue as a result of anxiety. Take my 7 minute anxiety test to find out how your anxiety compares to others and whether swollen tongue may be one of those symptoms. Click here to take the test.\n\nAn enlarged or swollen tongue can also occur as an allergic reaction to medications or other substances. In this case, the swelling is due to fluid accumulation in the tissues of the tongue, medically known as angioedema. A dramatically swollen tongue can lead to breathing problems and may be a medical emergency. Treatment of allergic reactions that include swollen tongue can include epinephrine, antihistamines, and/or steroid medications.\n\nSwollen tongue is arguably one of the most unusual anxiety symptoms you can experience, and not everyone experiences it. Many people worry that their sore tongue means something more serious-and indeed, there are many serious conditions that can cause a swollen tongue.\n\nThe reality is that anxiety doesn't necessarily cause a swollen tongue per se. What anxiety causes is the feeling **of a swollen tongue. It causes the sensation that your tongue is numb/uncomfortable and growing in size even though it isn't actually growing. This is part of the hyper-sensitization of panic disorder and health anxiety.\n\nSwelling of the tongue can occur due to inflammation of the tongue (known as glossitis), the presence of abnormal substances (such as amyloid protein) in the tongue, the collection of fluid in the tongue as a result of different disease processes, or tumors that infiltrate the tissues of the tongue.\n\nPlease answer this query: what are causes of swelling of my tongue?\nIf it is not possible to answer the query using the given prompts, please state: No Answer Present.\n",

    "With the following passages:\nTetanus immunization \u2014 Tetanus is a serious, potentially life-threatening infection that can be transmitted by an animal or human bite. Adults who are bitten should receive a tetanus vaccine (called a tetanus toxoid vaccine) if the most recent tetanus vaccine was greater than 5 years ago.\n\nMost dog bites occur in children, with the highest number seen in boys between the ages of five and nine years old. The head and neck are the most common site of bites in children up to age 10 years, probably because a child's head is close to the level of a large dog's mouth. The arms and legs, particularly the right hand, are the most frequent site of injury for older children and adults.\n\nGet a tetanus shot as recommended by your doctor every 10 years. As a good practice, keep track of all tetanus shots and boosters. Know that tetanus enters the body with a pinprick, cut, puncture wound, deep scrape, burn, or other injuries that break the skin or mucous membrane.\n\nOr see your doctor about a tetanus booster for any wound \u2014 especially if it might have been contaminated with dirt, animal feces or manure \u2014 if you haven't had a booster shot within the past 10 years or aren't sure of when you were last vaccinated.\n\nAnimal bites are a common problem in the United States, with two to five million occurring each year. Children are bitten more often than adults. The vast majority of animal bites are caused by dogs (85 to 90 percent), with the remainder caused by cats (5 to 10 percent) and rodents (2 to 3 percent). The most feared complication of an animal bite is rabies, although skin infection is the most common complication.\n\nWhen to see a doctor. See your doctor for a tetanus booster shot if you have a deep or dirty wound and you haven't had a booster shot in five years. If you aren't sure of when your last booster was, get a booster.\n\nHow to Know When you Need a Tetanus Shot. Tetanus is a medical condition affecting the skeletal muscle occurring from an infection through a wound that causes contamination. It can involve a cut or deep puncture wound, such as stepping on a nail or getting cut with a piece of glass. As the infection worsens, muscle spasms in the jaw develop first, known as lockjaw. People of all ages need tetanus shots to prevent this condition. Note that tetanus is a disease which can be fatal. It is caused by bacteria found in dust, soil and manure. The bacterial spores live in the soil.\n\nSigns and symptoms of tetanus appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after tetanus bacteria enter your body through a wound. The average incubation period is seven to 10 days. Common signs and symptoms of tetanus include: Spasms and stiffness in your jaw muscles (trismus)\n\nBesides a tetanus shot, your doctor may also give you an injection of something called tetanus immune globulin, which acts fast to prevent infection. There is a small window of opportunity for the tetanus immune globulin to work, so don't delay seeking medical care.\n\nAfter those first series of shots, you should receive a booster shot every 10 years. If you step on a nail or suffer a wound that is deep and dirty, and haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 10 years, you need help fast. Seek medical attention immediately and rinse the wound with tap water. Do not cleanse with soap or apply antiseptic to a deep wound.\n\nPlease answer this query: when do you need a tetanus shot\nIf it is not possible to answer the query using the given prompts, please state: No Answer Present.\n",
    "With the following passages:\nEndocrine system keeps the body's hormone and secretion levels in balance. Since there is a whole series of organs and glands that must work in tandem to maintain healthy hormone and secretion levels, when one of them doesn't function the way it's supposed to function, it puts a heavy strain on the rest of the body.\n\nThe endocrine system is the collection of glands of an organism that secrete hormones directly into the circulatory system to be carried towards distant target organs. The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling.\n\nThe endocrine system uses hormones to control and coordinate your body's internal metabolism (or homeostasis) energy level, reproduction, growth and development, and response to injury, stress, and environmental factors. Consider the following hormones and their role in the workings of the endocrine system: Where the hormone is produced. Hormone(s) secreted. Hormone function. Adrenal glands. Aldosterone. Regulates salt, water balance, and blood pressure. Adrenal glands.\n\nThe Endocrine System. The endocrine system is a unique and essential part of normal body function. Where the nervous system handles functions that happen quickly, like breathing and body movement, the endocrine system handles body functions that happen much slower, such as the growth of cells, organs, and metabolism.\n\nThe pituitary gland and hypothalamus both control the thyroid. When thyroid hormone levels drop too low, the hypothalamus secretes TSH Releasing Hormone (TRH), which alerts the pituitary to produce thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The thyroid responds to this chain of events by producing more hormones.\n\n- the primary responsibility of the endocrine system is to regulate the body's growth and development, control the function of various tissues, support pregnancy and other reproductive functions and regulates metabolism. - the endocrine organs secrete the hormones directly into the bloodstream. - the hormones binds with special proteins.\n\nGet free help! 1  80% of questions are answered in under 10 minutes. 2  Answers come with explanations, so that you can learn. 3  Answer quality is ensured by our experts.\n\nEndocrine Glands.

It is for health care professional use only and not for self testing.\n\nIntroduction. Rapid testing for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine or serum using point-of-care (POC) test devices is frequently performed in health care settings to identify a possible pregnancy.\n\nThe negative predictive value of both tests was 99.9%. Qualitative serum hCG testing could be replaced by quantitative hCG tests, but there is no clear advantage to doing so.\n\nFourth, because the only clinical use of a qualitative serum hCG test is to detect (or rule out) a possible pregnancy, it can be argued that the most analytically sensitive test available (ie, quantitative) should be used.\n\nAbstract. Qualitative and quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) tests are used to diagnose pregnancy. We assessed physicians' perceptions and compared turnaround times (TATs) and performance characteristics of both tests. We surveyed 1,058 physicians about their perceptions of hCG tests.\n\nWeak positive results may take a longer time, up to 5 minutes, to develop. The CLIA waived ,\u2122 Inc.

Yes, there are several situations in which a positive serum hCG test may be seen in a nonpregnant woman: 1  The pituitary secretes hCG, especially around the time of menopause. 2  The woman has a biochemical pregnancy: the hCG test is positive in the absence of other signs of pregnancy.\n\nSerum pregnancy tests measure human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which is produced by placental syncytiotrophoblasts following implantation. hCG is composed of 2 subunits: alpha and beta. The hCG, Total, Quantitative test (test code 8396[X]) detects intact hCG molecules and free beta-subunits of the hCG molecule. The serum hCG test can be positive as early as 7-10 days following conception. However, in some pregnant women, the test is not positive 7-10 days after conception. This is because the time to implantation (and production of hCG) can be longer in some women. So a negative result does not rule out pregnancy, and repeat testing may be indicated.

An ischemic stroke occurs when a clot or a mass blocks a blood vessel, cutting off blood flow to a part of the brain.Close-up of a clot inside an artery that provides blood flow to the brainBrain tissue affected by blockage.\n\nAnother condition that\u2019s similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack, also called a TIA or \u201cmini-stroke.\u201d A TIA occurs if blood flow to a portion of the brain is blocked only for a short time. Thus, damage to the brain cells isn\u2019t permanent (lasting).\n\n1 Hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain breaks or ruptures. 2  The result is blood seeping into the brain tissue, causing damage to brain cells. 3  The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are high blood pressure and brain aneurysms.\n\nFind out if you have atrial fibrillation (AF). If you have AF, work with your doctor to manage it. Atrial fibrillation can cause blood to collect in the chambers of your heart. This blood can form clots and cause a stroke.\n\nStroke 101: Fast Facts on Stroke \uf0b7 Stroke is a brain attack, cutting off vital blood flow and oxygen to the brain. \uf0b7 In the United States, stroke is a leading cause of death, killing nearly 130,000 people each year, and a leading cause of serious, long-term adult disability.\n\n\uf0b7 Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain breaks leaking blood into the brain. Hemorrhagic strokes account for thirteen percent of all strokes, yet are responsible for more than thirty percent of all stroke deaths.\n\nAsk your doctor if you have circulation problems. If so, work with your doctor to control them. Fatty deposits can block arteries that carry blood from your heart to your brain. Sickle cell disease, severe anemia, or other diseases can cause stroke if left untreated.\n\n\uf0b7 Two million brain cells die every minute during stroke, increasing risk of permanent brain damage, disability or death. Recognizing symptoms and acting FAST to get medical attention can save a life and limit disabilities. \uf0b7 The prevalence of transient ischemic attacks (TIA \u2013 \u201cmini strokes\u201d) increases with age.\n\nThere are two types of ischemic strokes. \u2022 Thrombotic strokes are caused by a blood clot (thrombus) in an artery going to the brain. The clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain. Blood clots usually form in arteries damaged by plaque. \u2022 Embolic strokes are caused by a wandering clot (embolus) that\u2019s formed elsewhere (usually in the heart or neck arteries). Clots are carried in the bloodstream and block a blood vessel in or leading to the brain.\n\nIschemic is the more common type of stroke. An ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs if an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures (breaks open).

Subsequently, the study should transition from breadth of study to focusing more on depth.\n\nCombined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other).\n\nThe mixing of arms is sometimes pushed down below the level where homogeneity ordinarily prevails, for example by temporarily attaching a tank company to an infantry battalion.\n\nIt is an example of why generals needed to use combined arms to overcome the tactics used by enemy officers to frustrate an attack by a single arm of an army. In contrast the 27th (Inniskilling) suffered 478 casualties from an initial strength of 750 because of their exposure to attack by French combined arms.\n\nThere is but one art, and that is the tactics of the combined arms.

Typically, the maid of honor hosts the bridal shower. About a decade ago, it was frown on for the anyone in the bride\u2019s immediate family to host here a bridal shower as it looks like she\u2019s trying to get gifts for the bride. However, that view is now outdated.\n\nBest Answer: A bridal shower & a kitchen tea are actually two different things. At a bridal shower, the bride is 'showered' with gifts to help create a home, without reference to a particular room. These gifts make up part of her dowry. There is usually champagne & nibbles served but no 'real' food.\n\nA bridal shower is usually given by the maid of honor, the bridal party (as a group) or a close friend(s) and is usually kept as a secret from the bride. Traditionally, it was considered inappropriate for the bride's immediate family to host the shower, since it would appear that they are simply asking for gifts.\n\nThe answer to this question rests mainly on who is hosting the bridal shower, their budget, and how creative they want to be. A bridal shower can take place in someone's home, the bride's favorite restaurant, a reception hall, or maybe even a special location of the couple's like a park.\n\nI got an invitation for a  Kitchen Tea  and this person has booked a hall out for the event.

Friends and family gather together and have a small party for the bride. The highlight for day are usually \u2013 the games, the activities and the bride opening her gifts.\n\nYou can have a shower up to 6 months before the wedding. If many guests are traveling from out of town, it may make sense to have it close to the wedding, so they can attend.
