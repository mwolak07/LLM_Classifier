Using only the following context:
Seizures. Seizures are a symptom of epilepsy. Seizures (fits, convulsions) are episodes of disturbed brain function that cause changes in neuromuscular function, attention, or behavior. They are caused by abnormally excited electrical signals in the brain.

1 Hyponatremia may result from excess fluid in the body relative to a normal amount of sodium, or it may be due to a loss of sodium and body fluid.

Seizure (Definition). Seizure is also known as Generalized seizures in adults. A seizure is a symptom in which a person has a convulsion or epileptic attack, usually involving jerking movements of the head, limbs, and rest of the body.

Low sodium: Low serum sodium concentrations in circulating blood sure can lead to seizures. If serum sodium concentrations drop fast, then brain sweiling happens rapidly with compression of brain matter. Seizure, coma, brain herniation can result. Low serum sodium concentrations are not induced by low sodium diets. Please don't confuse these.

Clonazepam (Klonopin, generic) is recommended for myoclonic and atonic seizures that cannot be controlled by other drugs and for Lennox-Gastaut epilepsy syndrome. Although clonazepam can prevent generalized or partial seizures, patients generally develop tolerance to the drug, which causes seizures to recur.

These conditions include poisoning by prescription or recreational drugs, withdrawal from prescription or recreational drugs (including alcohol), brain injuries, general illnesses, and abnormal levels of blood salts (electrolytes -- including sodium).

1 Hyponatremia refers to a low level of sodium in the blood. 2  Hyponatremia may result from excess fluid in the body relative to a normal amount of sodium, or it may be due to a loss of sodium and body fluid.

Losing sodium quickly is a medical emergency. It can cause loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma. Common symptoms of low blood sodium include: 1  weakness. 2  fatigue or low energy. 3  headache. 4  nausea and vomiting. 5  muscle cramps or spasms. 6  confusion. 7  irritability.

Hyponatremia refers to a lower-than-normal level of sodium in the blood. Sodium is essential for many body functions including the maintenance of fluid balance, regulation of blood pressure, and normal function of the nervous system.

Sodium is the major positively charged ion (cation) in the fluid outside of cells of the body. The chemical notation for sodium is Na. When combined with chloride (Cl), the resulting substance is table salt (NaCl). The normal blood sodium level is 135 - 145 milliEquivalents/liter (mEq/L), or in international units, 135 - 145 millimoles/liter (mmol/L).
